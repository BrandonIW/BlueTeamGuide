Event Viewer (GUI-based application)
- Already familiar w/ this. Straight fwd

Wevtutil.exe (command-line tool)
- Cmdline version to query logs. Fairly straightforward but: wevtutil /? for more information. Some examples of cmds are as follows:

wevtutil qe Application /c:3 /rd:true /f:text --> Query the events in the Application Log. Read a max of 3 events, in reverse direction, and format the output as a human readable text

wevtutil qe Security /c:100 /f:text --> Query 100 events from Security log 


Get-WinEvent (PowerShell cmdlet)
