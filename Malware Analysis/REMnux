#----Overview
REMnux is a Linux toolkit used for reverse-Engineering & Malware Analysis.

#----Analyzing PDF Files with Peepdf
To initialliy analyze a PDF file for malicious content, the peepdf tool can be used. For example:
1) peepdf demo_notsuspicious.pdf  -> Outputs some metadata on the file, but also outputs the file's suspicious elements, such as embedded javascript
2) echo 'extract js > javascript-from-demo_notsuspicious.pdf' > extracted_javascript.txt  -> create an echo statement that is a script that extracts the javascript from a file and redirects into a .txt file. 
3) peepdf -s extracted_javascript.txt demo_notsuspicious.pdf -> Run our "extract js" script against our suspicious PDF file. 
4) cat javascript-from-demo_notsuspicioud.pdf -> View the javascript we've extracted 

#----Analyzing for Macros 
A common tool for this is vmonkey i.e. 
1) vmonkey file.doc -> Sends a ton of output giving you information about visual basic code within the document. 

#----File Entropy
File entropy is a rating that scores how random the data within a PE file is. With a scale of 0 to 8. 0 meaning the less "randomness" of the data in the file, where a scoring towards 8 indicates this data is more "random". 

Files that are encrypted will typically have a very high entropy level. Whereas files with typical chunks of similar data, will have lower entropy. 

This is relevant because when malware authors often use obfuscation techniques such as stego/encoding/encryption, these all tend to significantly increase overall file entropy.

Malware authors will typically use "packers" to take their malicious executable and modify it depending on the packer used. It could be compressed, or obfuscated somewhoe. Executables always have an "Entry Point" which is simply the first piece of code to be executed w/i the file. When a file is packed, it must be unpacked before any code can execute, and when its unpacked, we muyst know where the original location of the entry point is. When packing, packers change the entry point from the original location to what's called an "unpacking stub" which is where the unpacking will start.

Characteristics of Packed Files:
1) High Entropy
2) Very few imports
3) The executable may have sections named after certain packers such as UPX
