#---Overview
What are the indicators that malware has even been executed on a machine? Are there any files, processes, or perhaps any attempt of "un-ordinary" communication?
How does the malware perform? Does it attempt to infect other devices? Does it encrypt files or install anything like a backdoor / Remote Access Tool (RAT)?
Most importantly - can we ultimately prevent and/or detect further infection?!

#----Identifying
Malware tends to leave a heck of a papertrail of evidence. There is a ton to look into such as unusual network communications, file system changes/edits etc. Broadly, malware must be:

1) Delivered:
- USB, Phishing email, vulnerabilities such as XSS, etc. 

2) Executed:
- What does it do when executed in a sandbox (hopefully). Encrypt? Exfiltrate? Record keystrokes? etc. 

3) Maintain Persistence: 
- Obviously from malware's perspective, if you restart you PC and that deals w/ the problem, the malware is kinda shit.
- Often this requirement is what makes malware more noisy and detectable

4) Propagation
- Not always employed by malware. But also creates noise for detection


Host-Based Signatures
- These are generally speaking the results of execution and any persistence performed by the Malware. For example, has a file been encrypted? Has any additional software been installed? These are two of many, many host-based signatures that are useful to know to prevent and check against further infection.

Network-Based Signatures
- At an overview, this classification of signatures are the observation of any networking communication taking place during delivery, execution and propagation. For example, in Ransomware, where has the Malware contacted for Bitcoin payments?


#----Types of Analysis
1) Static
- This is more of a safe analysis of malware prior to any execution. We are examining its static state, such as its code, hash etc. 

2) Dynamic 
- Simply put, this is executing the malware and seeing what happens
